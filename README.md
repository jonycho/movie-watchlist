# Movie Watchlist 🔍🎥 

This project is created in HTML, CSS and JavaScript based on the The Open Movie Database API 🎞️. Find the title of a movie and then the page will display the titles that best match the search term. You can add a movie ✖️ to a Watchlist so you can have a list of favourites films (done with localStorage)
